<p>
  <%= pdm_logotype %> opposes <q>the willful exposure to the public of any principles of the Art of Magic or the method employed in any magic effect or illusion.</q> (<cite><a href="https://www.magician.org/pdf/JointIBMAndSamEthics.pdf">Joint <abbr title="International Brotherhood of Magicians">I.B.M.</abbr> and <abbr title="Society of American Magicians">S.A.M.</abbr> Ethics Statement</a></cite>).
  <%# To this end, we protect our downloads with a password that should only allow students, practitioners, and researchers of magic and the allied arts to download our ebooks from our website. %>
</p>
<p><%= pdm_logotype %> does not believe that our efforts constitute exposure. <a href="https://www.p-e-a.org/exposure.pdf">As defined</a> by the <a href="https://www.p-e-a.org">Psychic Entertainers Association</a>, &ldquo;exposure&rdquo; cannot be used to describe magic sections of libraries. <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> and <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">Project Gutenberg</a> are widely recognized as digital libraries, and <%= pdm_logotype :domain %> counts itself among them.</p>
<p>Kerrick Long, the founder of <%= pdm_logotype %>, disclosed this preservation and access work on his application to both the <a href="https://www.magicsam.com/default.aspx">Society of American Magicians</a> and the <a href="https://www.magician.org">International Brotherhood of Magicians</a>, making it very clear that he should not be accepted if this was incompatible with the joint ethics statement. He was proud to be accepted by both organizations, and is a member of both <a href="https://www.magician.org/membercheck?ibmid=RXRMYlJ5NUQ2VDd6aGhiNStGZGltQT09"><abbr title="International Brotherhood of Magicians">I.B.M.</abbr></a> and <a href="https://www.magicsam.com/members/public_profile.asp?id=80533142"><abbr title="Society of American Magicians">S.A.M.</abbr></a> today.</p>
