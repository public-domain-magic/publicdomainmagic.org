<%= content_for :page_title, "Accessibility" %>

<p>Our mission is to produce high-quality and free public domain ebooks, but none of that matters if people can’t read them. Consequently, we put a great deal of effort into making sure that our ebooks are as accessible as possible, for both the books’ content and the supporting metadata.</p>

<h2>Our Ebooks</h2>
<p>Our ebooks are built using semantic <abbr title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>. All images and other non-textual content have alternative text to describe their contents, and where appropriate longer descriptions in a list of illustrations. All our ebooks are, to the best of our knowledge, compliant with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/"><abbr title="Web Contant Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.2</a> level AA and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/"><abbr title="Electronic Publication">EPUB</abbr> Accessibility 1.1</a>.</p>
<p>We use metadata to indicate the accessibility of our ebooks. Each title comes with an <a href="https://www.editeur.org/83/Overview/"><abbr title="Online Information Exchange">ONIX</abbr> 3</a> declaration detailing its accessibility, and we also include <a href="https://schema.org">Schema.org</a> accessibility feature declarations in the package document.</p>
<p>Ebooks obtained from our website will never use any <abbr title="Digital Rights Management">DRM</abbr> technology so you’re free to amend or process them to better fit your own needs.</p>

<h2>Our Website</h2>
<p>Our website is built using valid semantic <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. Non-decorative images have alternative text to describe their contents. The site has a dark mode if preferred, and if you’d like to override this you can do that from the settings page. To the best of our knowledge, the site is compliant with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/"><abbr title="Web Contant Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.2</a> level AA.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>
<p>If you find that anything isn’t working for you then please email <%= mail_to "librarian@publicdomainmagic.org" %>. We’ll be happy to help directly, and will also investigate if there are any improvements we can make to our processes and corpus to better support you and other readers.</p>
