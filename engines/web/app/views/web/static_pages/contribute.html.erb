<%= content_for :page_title, "Get Involved" %>

<p><%= pdm_logotype %> is a volunteer-driven project, and thereâ€™s room for people of all skill levels to contribute.</p>

<p>At the most basic level, anyone can contribute feedback. Day-to-day readers can tell us about errors they spot in our ebooks. People with an eye for typography and a talent for editing can proofread whole ebooks. Technically inclined readers can produce ebooks themselves, or contribute via GitHub. Those familiar with copyright law and bibiliographical research can help determine the copyright status of post-<%= public_domain_year %> works. You can also make a financial contribution or donate a wanted book to help fund continued ebook development.</p>

<p>For all these and more, start by emailing <%= mail_to "librarian@publicdomainmagic.org" %>.</p>
