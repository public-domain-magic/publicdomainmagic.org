<p><%= pdm_logotype %> does not believe that our efforts constitute exposure. <a href="https://www.p-e-a.org/exposure.pdf">As defined</a> by the <a href="https://www.p-e-a.org">Psychic Entertainers Association</a>, &ldquo;exposure&rdquo; cannot be used to describe magic sections of libraries. <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> and <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">Project Gutenberg</a> are widely recognized as digital libraries, and <%= pdm_logotype :domain %> counts itself among them.</p>
<p>Kerrick Long, the founder of <%= pdm_logotype %>, disclosed this preservation and access work on his application to both the <a href="https://www.magicsam.com/default.aspx">Society of American Magicians</a> and the <a href="https://www.magician.org">International Brotherhood of Magicians</a>, making it very clear that he should not be accepted if this was incompatible with the joint ethics statement.
